    "A **credit score** is a numerical representation of an individual's creditworthiness, typically ranging from 300 to 850. It helps lenders assess the risk of lending money to individuals. Higher credit scores indicate better creditworthiness, meaning the individual is more likely to repay loans on time, while lower scores indicate higher risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Factors That Determine a Credit Score:\n",
    "1. **Payment History (35%)**:\n",
    "   - This is the most significant factor. It includes whether you’ve paid past credit accounts on time. Late payments, defaults, bankruptcies, and foreclosures negatively impact your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Credit Utilization (30%)**:\n",
    "   - This is the ratio of current credit card balances to the total credit limit. It’s recommended to keep credit utilization below 30%. For example, if your total credit limit is $10,000 and your balance is $3,000, your utilization rate is 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Length of Credit History (15%)**:\n",
    "   - The longer your credit history, the better. This includes the age of your oldest account, the average age of all accounts, and how long it’s been since you used certain accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Credit Mix (10%)**:\n",
    "   - Having a variety of credit types (e.g., credit cards, mortgages, auto loans) can help your score. It shows you can manage different types of debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **New Credit (10%)**:\n",
    "   - Opening several new credit accounts in a short period can negatively impact your score. Each time you apply for credit, a hard inquiry is made, which can lower your score temporarily."

    "Credit risk model building is the process of developing statistical or machine learning models to assess the likelihood that a borrower or customer will default on their financial obligations. These models are essential in banking, lending, and financial services as they help institutions quantify the level of risk associated with granting loans or credit to customers. A critical model within this domain is the Probability of Default (PD) model, which estimates the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan within a specific timeframe, often one year."
